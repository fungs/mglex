# Don't forget to implement

- give seeds in term of line indices and do not pass sequences names
- convert seed indices to log responsibility matrix
- start with responsibility matrix for clustering (universal approach)
- use np.dot with out= for performance and memory efficiency
- for fast poisson density calculation, maybe use Loader's algorithm (http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/stats/poisson)
- docstrings for all classes and functions

- compare and merge difference for weighted kmer frequences by sequence length (no difference seen so far)
